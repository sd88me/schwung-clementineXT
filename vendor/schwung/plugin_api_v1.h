/*
 * Schwung Plugin API v1
 *
 * Stable ABI for DSP modules loaded by the host runtime.
 * Modules are .so files loaded via dlopen() and must export move_plugin_init_v1().
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * THREADING CONTRACT — READ THIS FIRST
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * THERE IS NO CONTROL THREAD. Every entry point below runs on the SPI audio
 * callback: SCHED_FIFO 70, pinned to core 3, with roughly 2370 microseconds
 * of slack per 128-frame block.
 *
 * Both numbers were measured and both replace older ones that are still
 * quoted in places. FIFO 70: the 2026-08-22 RT-thread audit found nothing
 * anywhere in the MoveOriginal process above 70 (the SPI *driver* is a
 * separate kernel thread and is a different question). 2370 us: the
 * 2026-08-26 SPI frame tally found the transfer itself is 389 us, not the
 * ~2 ms long assumed -- the rest of the ioctl is idle IRQ wait, which is
 * slack you may spend. Arm them yourself rather than trusting this comment:
 * `rt_thread_audit_on` and `spi_tally_on`.
 *
 *      create_instance     <- yes, this one too
 *      destroy_instance
 *      set_param           <- yes, this one too
 *      get_param           <- yes, this one too
 *      on_midi / process_midi
 *      render_block / process_block / tick
 *
 * This is the single most misunderstood thing about writing a Schwung module.
 * A 2026-08 audit of all 113 catalogued modules found ~150 confirmed realtime
 * violations, and several carried comments asserting the opposite in so many
 * words — "control-thread only (blocking dir + file I/O)", "run on the control
 * thread, NEVER from process_block, so this malloc is realtime-safe", "safe
 * because it runs in the MIDI callback (not the RT render thread)". Every one
 * of those premises is false, and each produced a multi-megabyte blocking
 * operation on the audio thread. If you take one thing from this header, take
 * this paragraph.
 *
 * FORBIDDEN in all of the calls listed above:
 *
 *   - file I/O: fopen/fread/fwrite/open/read/stat/opendir/readdir/mkdir/unlink
 *   - allocation or free: malloc/calloc/realloc/free/new/delete
 *   - locks held by any non-RT thread (and any lock without PRIO_INHERIT)
 *   - fork/exec/system/popen, dlopen
 *   - logging of any kind, including host->log and a bare fprintf(stderr, ...)
 *     -- stderr is unbuffered, so that is a write() syscall even when your
 *     debug flag is off
 *   - unbounded work: an FFT, a full-buffer memset, a directory sort
 *
 * The symptom is not a glitch in your module. It is a device-wide audio
 * dropout, because you are holding the thread that services every other
 * module's audio and Move's own.
 *
 * THREADS INHERIT SCHED_FIFO 70. pthread_create() called from any of the
 * above hands your worker the callback's realtime priority. Move's own
 * `Link Main` thread runs at SCHED_FIFO 35, so an inherited-priority worker
 * starves Move's audio publisher and produces exactly the dropouts you were
 * trying to avoid by going off-thread. Every worker must demote itself as its
 * FIRST action:
 *
 *      struct sched_param sp = { .sched_priority = 0 };
 *      sched_setscheduler(0, SCHED_OTHER, &sp);
 *      // and keep core 3 free for SPI:
 *      cpu_set_t set; CPU_ZERO(&set);
 *      CPU_SET(0, &set); CPU_SET(1, &set); CPU_SET(2, &set);
 *      sched_setaffinity(0, sizeof(set), &set);
 *
 * Reference implementations that get this right: schwung-keydetect
 * (keyfinder_wrapper.cpp -- demotes and pins) and schwung-airwindows
 * (clap_fx.cpp loader_thread_fn -- demotes, with a comment naming the
 * inheritance problem). The audit found at least 14 modules that do not.
 *
 * WHAT TO DO INSTEAD. Load files, allocate buffers and build lists on your own
 * SCHED_OTHER worker thread, and have the audio path pick up the result by
 * publishing a pointer. Keep get_param cheap: a `get_param` that rescans a
 * directory is served on this thread once per repaint, not once per click.
 * If you must do work at create time, prefer doing it lazily on the worker and
 * rendering silence until it lands.
 *
 * ONE QUALIFICATION, and it does not weaken any rule above. An audio FX loaded
 * into a chain SLOT is created, configured and processed on the callback, as
 * described. An audio FX loaded into a chain BUS insert position is loaded by
 * the chain's bus worker (SCHED_OTHER, cores 0-2): its dlopen, create_instance,
 * destroy_instance and the set_param that restores its saved state run THERE,
 * while process_block, on_midi and every live set_param/get_param still run on
 * the callback. So:
 *
 *   - You still may not do any of the forbidden things above at create time.
 *     You have no way to know which of the two you were loaded as, and the slot
 *     case — the common one — is the callback.
 *   - Process-global initialisation must be thread-safe. The same module can be
 *     constructed on the worker for a bus and on the callback for a slot AT THE
 *     SAME TIME. Per-instance state is unaffected; a shared static table, a
 *     lazily-built wavetable or a library init that is not reentrant is not.
 *
 * "There is no control thread" remains the rule to write code against. This is
 * the one place the host does not hold still, and it buys you nothing.
 *
 * See docs/REALTIME_SAFETY.md for the measurements behind all of this.

     * we do not have, and the guard then tests memory belonging to somebody
     * else.
     *
     * That is not hypothetical. breakbeat's copy appends

     * NO Schwung has ever provided -- so it resolves to +120, one past our

     * at the end for ABI compatibility", which is the right instinct applied
     * in the wrong direction: appending lets a module be OLDER than the host,
     * never newer. A module cannot extend this struct from its side.
     *
     * The same binary calls the real get_bpm() at +88, so the two offsets sit
     * side by side in one disassembly. The struct a chain sub-plugin gets is
     * chain_instance_t::subplugin_host_api, so +120 read the NEXT MEMBER of
     * that instance — non-NULL, so the module's own guard passed, and the blr
     * jumped into the heap. SIGSEGV on the SPI callback at load, which takes
     * MoveOriginal down with it and boot-loops the device if the slot is
     * restored.
     *
     * Zeroed by construction: every instance of this struct is a static or a
     * member of a calloc'd instance, and chain_host memcpy's sizeof(). So an
     * over-read by up to 64 bytes finds NULL and the caller's existing guard
     * does what it was always written to do.
     *
     * This does NOT make the ABI extensible. Appending a real field still
     * requires modules to be rebuilt; the reserved run only buys a safe
     * failure instead of a crash.
     *
     * SO DO NOT CONSUME THIS RUN — not from the front, and not from the back.
     * Its FRONT IS +120: replacing reserved[0] with a real field puts a live
     * pointer at exactly the offset breakbeat calls, breakbeat's own
     * `if (host->fn)` guard passes, and the device boot-loops again. Taking
     * from the back shortens the run instead, and old binaries start reaching
     * past it. A new host capability goes through a dlsym'd export
     * (move_plugin_render_split, chain_take_midi_tick_wake,
     * chain_set_clip_phase), which is what that precedent is for.
     *

 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * A sound generator can offer to render named voices into SEPARATE buffers, so
 * the Signal Chain can put a kick and a snare on different insert chains and
 * different sends. Two things opt in, and both are optional -- a module that
 * does neither is rendered exactly as it always was.
 *
 *   1. get_param("split_voices") answers a FLAT ORDERED JSON array:
 *
 *          [{"id":"kick","label":"Kick"},{"id":"snare","label":"Snare"}]
 *
 *      ENTRY i IS BUFFER i. The host resolves the bus->voice map in C on the
 *      SPI callback and its JSON helpers cannot walk ui_hierarchy's `levels`
 *      in order, so this list is flat and its ORDER is the contract. Never
 *      reorder it between versions: a bus stores voice IDS, and an id that no
 *      longer resolves is reported as an orphan rather than silently
 *      re-pointed. Adding a voice at the END is safe; inserting one is not.
 *      Answer "" (or do not serve the key) to say "I cannot split".
 *
 *   2. Export this symbol -- NOT a field on plugin_api_v2_t:
 *
 *          void move_plugin_render_split(void *instance,
 *                                        int16_t *const *voice_out,
 *                                        int n_voices,
 *                                        int16_t *main_out, int frames);
 *
 *      A SEPARATE EXPORTED SYMBOL ON PURPOSE. Appending to plugin_api_v2_t is
 *      what boot-looped a device via breakbeat's header drift: a module cannot
 *      extend the ABI from its side, and a guarded read of a field the host
 *      does not have tests memory belonging to somebody else. A dlsym'd symbol
 *      is absent-or-present, with no offset to get wrong.
 *
 * IT ACCUMULATES -- the opposite of render_block, which overwrites. The host
 * clears every destination before the call, main_out included. NEVER memset a
 * destination yourself: main_out and the voice_out[] entries alias each other,
 * so clearing one of them is clearing somebody else's audio for that frame.
 *
 * main_out IS FOR AUDIO THAT BELONGS TO NO VOICE -- a drum bus, a mix
 * compressor, a global filter, an internal reverb return. It is the same
 * buffer an unassigned voice is handed, so it is usually reachable through
 * voice_out[] as well; it is passed explicitly so that it is reachable even
 * when EVERY voice is on a bus and no voice_out[] entry points at main. A
 * module with no master section simply ignores it. Accumulate into it under
 * exactly the same rules as voice_out[]: never more than `frames` frames, and
 * never an overwrite.
 *
 * ITS voice_out[] ENTRIES ALIAS. Two voices routed to the same bus are handed
 * the SAME pointer, so their sum happens inside your own render loop with no
 * mixing pass at all, and a voice on no bus is handed the main output buffer,
 * so the sparse case costs nothing. Therefore:
 *
 *   - ACCUMULATE (out[i] += sample, saturating). Overwriting turns two voices
 *     on one bus into whichever one wrote last.
 *   - NEVER write more than `frames` frames (frames * 2 samples) into any
 *     voice_out[] entry. Those buffers are shared, so an overrun is a
 *     different bus's audio, not your own tail. Nothing checks this for you.
 *   - Both entry points must be STATE-COMPATIBLE. The host switches between
 *     render_split and render_block AT RUNTIME, PER FRAME, on whether any of
 *     your voices is currently assigned to a bus -- assigning one voice on the
 *     shadow UI flips your active entry point mid-stream with no reload. Same
 *     voice allocator, same envelope/LFO/phase state, or the flip is audible.
 *
 * n_voices is what the host parsed from your own list (clamped to its own
 * maximum), so it can be SHORTER than the list you published. Index
 * voice_out[] only in [0, n_voices).
 *
 * Runs on the SPI callback, under every rule at the top of this header.
 * See docs/CHAIN.md ("Buses") and src/host/bus_mix.h.
